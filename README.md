# CADCD_TO_KITTI_COMPLETE

This script converts all metadata elements of the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions Dataset to match KITTI's format for performing validation using 3D and 2D object classification models that are adapted to the KITTI dataset. Please note: The CADCD extrinsic calibration parameters were changed in 2019; so please when converting the 2019 samples, make sure to uncomment line 163 and comment line 166. Otherwise, keep the code as is.
